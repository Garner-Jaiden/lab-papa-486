# Dev Lab QUEBEC

_Satisfy the  Agile System Development User Story & Meet all of the Minimum Acceptance Criteria_

## User Story (:shirt: large) 

**As an** individual dev 

**I want** to demonstrate a full stack data round trip 

**So that** I am qualified to work on a capstone dev team (and get an awesome job) 

## Minimum Acceptance Criteria

- from scratch, create a web-based model-view-controller (MVC) single page application (SPA) 
- required technology stack: node.js, express.js, MongoDb, ejs
- source code: configure a local and remote development environment using git & gitHub with proper security and access configurations, gitignore
- development features to include: nodemon, representational state transfer (RESTful API), dotenv (for secrets/credentials) 
- the APP must clearly demonstrate the create, read, update, & delete (CRUD) functionality as HTTP ‚Äúverbs‚Äù of POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. 
  - a full stack, data round trip, with persistent data 
- APP is deployed on Render or an alternative platform-as-a-service (PaaS)
- APP is self-describing, authorship attributed
- APP uses standard front-end frameworks: normalize.css, BS5, jQuery/UI
- Submission
  - To submit, create a verbose Pull Request (P/R) to our Class Repository
  - the P/R updates the Class Page with a clean & described reference to your APP. 
  - Do not merge the P/R or resolve any associated Issues (that‚Äôs my job!)
